\section{Introduction}

Here, write a brief introduction to the problem you are solving. This can be adapted from your problem description and motivation from the original proposal. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.

\section{Related Work}

Here, talk about the related work you encountered for your approach. Cite at least 5 references. Refer to item 2. No one has done exactly your task? Write about the most similar thing you can find. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.

\section{Dataset}

You should write about your dataset here, following the guidelines regarding item 1. This section may be 0.5-1 pages. Depending on your specific dataset, you may want to include subsections for the preprocessing, annotation, etc.

\section{Features}

Describe any features you used for your model, or how your data was input to your model. Are you doing feature engineering or feature selection? Are you learning embeddings? Is it all part of one neural network? Refer to item 2. This may range from 0.25 pages to 0.5 pages.

\section{Implementation}

Describe your model and implementation here. Refer to item 4. This may take around a page.

\section{Results and Evaluation}
In our evaluation stage, we use stratified K-fold cross-validation. The reason for this choice is that our dataset contains only 918 patient records, and using a fixed train/validation/test split may lead to overfitting due to the small number of data points.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{kfoldvalidation.png}
\caption{5-fold cross validation demonstrating precision (Type II error) of each fold}
\label{fig:experiments}
\end{figure}

The metrics used in this project include accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and AUC–ROC. Our rationale for choosing these metrics is as follows.
First, in disease prediction, precision (closely related to Type II error) is especially important. Hospitals cannot afford to misclassify a patient with the disease as healthy. Therefore, minimizing false negatives is crucial.
In addition, we use the AUC–ROC curve because it is an effective way to evaluate the overall performance of a binary classifier.

\section{Feedback and Plans}

Our TA (Alex Abrehforoush) gave us two main pieces of feedback.
First, in data preprocessing, our team converted several nominal categories into numbers using label encoding. For example, the four chest-pain types were encoded as 0, 1, 2, and 3. The TA suggested using one-hot encoding instead to examine whether the model performance improves.

The second suggestion concerns model performance: since the RBF-SVM model achieved only 86% accuracy, the TA recommended exploring another approach such as a neural network, which may help overcome the performance bottleneck.

Following the TA’s suggestions, we will first implement one-hot encoding for the nominal categories and compare the performance. Afterward, our group will create a new GitHub branch named neural-network to experiment with a different model architecture.

\end{table*}

Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

\subsection{References}

\nocite{Ando2005,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015}

Many websites where you can find academic papers also allow you to export a bib file for citation or bib formatted entry. Copy this into the \texttt{custom.bib} and you will be able to cite the paper in the \LaTeX{}. You can remove the example entries.

\subsection{Equations}

An example equation is shown below:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:example}
  A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

Labels for equation numbers, sections, subsections, figures and tables
are all defined with the \verb|\label{label}| command and cross references
to them are made with the \verb|\ref{label}| command.
This an example cross-reference to Equation~\ref{eq:example}. You can also write equations inline, like this: $A=\pi r^2$.
